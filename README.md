# React_ButtonPublish

Patika.dev is the project I made within the scope of the 4th assignment.

#buttonassigt

I developed a component called buttonassigt and published this component on npmjs. You can access the component at https://www.npmjs.com/package/buttonassigt.
In the project, it can change the name and image of 5 different buttons with the text prop.

You can see last view below.
